# hermione-tutorial

Project started in January 05, 2022.

## Set up 

- install dependencies with `poetry install`
- run `pre-commit install` to set up the git hook scripts in the .git directory of your project
- run `pre-commit autoupdate` to update the repository references in the .pre-commit-config.yaml file

When all hooks combined in the pipeline the workflow look like this ([image credit](https://rohitgupta.xyz/blog/keeping-python-code-clean-with-pre-commit-hooks-black-flake8-and-isort/))
